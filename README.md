First Of all Downloaded Spam Mails Dataset (credits of dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset)
Below are the steps for Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning
1. The objective is to implement a Naïve Bayesian anti-spam filter to segregate spam from ham and measure its efficiency using various cost-effective measures.

2. A supervised learning approach is used to enable the filter to differentiate between spam and ham

3. The filter is trained on 70% of spam & ham corpus that requires Feature Extraction and calculation of spam probability of the extracted feature using a naïve Bayes
